# Java Spring Boot API QA Project

"The overall objective of the project is to create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during training with QA."

# Purpose of the Project:
The purpose of this project was to build a basic Spring Boot book application connected to a MySQL database with CRUD functionality. It tests my ability to build a simple back-end Java application that utilises a MySQL database to carry out HTTP Requests. The project was an opportunity to display my understanding so far, of software development, the technologies I have been learning with QA, as well as incorporating project management methodologies into my work flow.

# How I Expected the Challenge to Go:

Initially, I was a little nervous to take on the challenge of the project as it was my first project and I had spent a short space of time on the course learning a vast amount of information. My biggest concerns regarded time constraints, particularly as the project involved incorporating project management practices that I hadn’t utilised some time.  However, I knew I had all the resources I needed to complete my project so I persevered.</details>

# What Went Well & What Didn’t Go As Planned:

Using Jira to plan took some time. Building the application itself was fine and I felt comfortable doing it. Using MySQL again didn’t start off so good as I had forgotten my credentials and my MacBook was causing me some issues, however once I had sorted that out, I was fine with managing my database and getting my Postman requests to work was relieving. Testing took up a lot more time than I had wanted and it caused some frustrations however overall, things seemed to work out in the end and I was relieved. The night before submission, I realised all my commit histories on GitHub were disconnected to the main head so I could not merge any of my changes to my main, which is why I had to start a new repo.</details>

# Possible Improvements for Future Revisions of the Project:

The program is basic, but it does what it needs to do. However, in the future it would be nice to put in more tables and work on the front-end by adding a user-interface to it as I enjoy being creative.</details>
